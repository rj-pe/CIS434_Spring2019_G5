<h2><u>Final Report</u></h2>
<h3>Process of creating Chess Game </h3>
  <p></p>

<h3>Software features</h3>
  <p>
      <em>Object Oriented Architecture</em>: The software is built using the principles of object oriented design.
      The most important components in the game system are described and implemented as classes. Each class contains
      fields which represent data and information which are important for the object to retain and develop. Each class
      contains methods which allow access and modification to it's fields as well as special methods which enable objects
      to perform detailed computations and build lists. Some of the classes are broken up using the inheritance abstraction.
      For example inheritance is used in the BoardPiece class. All board pieces can share several integral properties,
      but each piece must also adhere to specific rules. The common functionality that is shared by all pieces is implemented
      in the BoardPiece super class, while the specific functionality unique to each piece type is implemented in a child
      class.
  </p>
  <p><em>Graveyard</em>: The Graveyard stores the captured pieces of the enemy player and displays them. It is created as its own class,
      which is created by the player class in order to keep them separate. The Graveyard keeps the captured pieces within the captured 
      ArrayList of the boardPiece class. It contains a method called addPiece which adds the piece to the ArrayList, and a method 
      called getGraveyard to return the captured ArrayList.
  </p>
    
  <p><em>Capturing</em>: When a piece owned by the player moves to an appropriate enemy piece within range, the player captures that piece. The
    capturing process is part of the Player class.
  </p>
    
  <p><em>Castling</em>: Castling is a special rule in Chess that permits the King and the Rook to switch positions. It is limited by
      the following circumstances: neither the King nor Rook have moved, there are no pieces in the spaces between them, and the King is 
      not threatened in any of the spaces it must move through.
  </p>

  <p>
      <em>Chess Engine</em>: When the software user requests to play against the computer, the chess engine allows the game to
      play with a baseline level of strategy. The chess engine helps the computer player to determine an optimal chess move
      given a set of constraints. The chess engine considers every move available to every piece on the computer player's
      team and assigns each move a score based on basic chess decision making theory. The factors that contribute to the
      engine's move scoring system are: net material consequence, determination of net change in the computer king's
      safety, any change in the mobility of the moved piece, and whether the move puts either king in check or checkmate.
  </p>
  <p>
      Net material consequence is calculated by adding the valuations of each piece on both teams. Pieces on the computer's
      team contribute positively to the move's valuation score, pieces on the opponents team contribute negatively to the
      move's valuation score. Any net change in the computer king's safety is measured by analyzing whether the move opens
      any lanes that are directly adjacent to the king. Change in the mobility of the moved piece is measured by comparing
      the size of the piece's list of available moves before and after the move takes place.
  </p>
  <p>
      <em>Chess Arbiter</em>: The chess arbiter's role is to monitor the status of the game. The arbiter tracks the impact
      of each move taken by either player on both the white and black kings. The arbiter is responsible for determining
      when a move puts either king in check. This is accomplished by looking through all of the opposing player's
      available moves and determining if any of those moves put the king in check. In order to determine whether a king
      is in checkmate, the arbiter must first determine that the king is in check. After check has been established, the
      arbiter must determine whether the king's teammates can aid in any way. Defensive moves include moving to a position
      that blocks a lane which threatens the king or capturing an opponent which holds the king in check. If no defensive
      moves are possible and the king cannot move from his current position, checkmate is declared and the game ends.
  </p>
  <p>
      <em>Documentation</em>: The source code is fully documented using javadoc technology. Each class, field, constructor,
       and method is accompanied by a javadoc description. The javadoc descriptions include a brief overview of the
      functionality provided, how the functionality is provided, any parameters required, any return value provided, and
      link to any classes or objects that are important for understanding the description. The javadoc source is compiled
      and presented as a collection of <a href="documentation/overview-tree.html">web pages</a>.

<h3>Difficulties encountered </h3>
<p>As the team is developing the game in the agile method, we are organizing our development efforts around
    incremental delivery. Each increment is described by a GitHub
    <a href="https://github.com/rj-pe/CIS434_Spring2019_G5/projects/1">Issue </a>.
    This section details the outstanding issues which we are planning to address in future development increments:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Collision detection</i> -- makes sure that pieces can’t move over others.</li>

    <li><i>Castling</i> -- This is a special move that can be performed once in a game by each player.</li>

    <li><i>Capturing</i> -- This increment will allow pieces to capture other pieces.</li>

    <li><i>Check and Check-mate</i> -– This increment will develop the logic for attacking the King.</li>

    <li><i>Documentation</i> -- Go back and complete JavaDoc for existing classes and include documentation
        for any future code additions. </li>

    <li><i>GUI Implementation</i> -- Adapt command line solution to a graphical one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solutions implemented </h3>
<ul>
    <li><i>Collision detection</i> -- Added a method to check for enemies / friendly pieces. When one of these is
        encountered, the player is notified. Collision detection is particularly important when a piece is determining
        it's potential moves. If a collision with a teammate is detected the piece must limit it's potential moves
        accordingly. If a collision with an enemy is detected, the piece can take but must also limit it's potential
        moves.
    </li>

    <li><i>Castling</i> -- Castling is a special King movement which consists of the king moving two spaces towards
        the rook and the rook moves to the position over which the king moved. In order to accomplish this, boardPiece contains the 
        boolean hasMoved which is set to true when a piece is processed through the transferPiece method. In the King class, this 
        boolean is checked to be false. If it is false, then it will look through the spaces between and check to see that they are 
        unoccupied, and not threatened. If it passes 0through this check, then it sets a boolean canCastleL or canCastleR to true. 
        These booleans indicate the direction of the rook piece. The King class then checks to see if the Rook's space is occupied, if 
        it is occupied by a Rook, and if it has moved. If all of these are valid, it sets the the space where the King transitions to as
        a possible move. Moving the rook is handled by the GameController class. During the process of movement, the pieceMovementHandler
        method checks to see if the piece is the king. If it is, it checks to see the number of spaces it moved by calculating the
        distance between the starting space and the selected space. If it is more than one or less than negative one, it moves the Rook
        appropriately.</li>

    <li><i>Capturing</i> -- If a piece captures another piece, the game should removes the captured piece and places
        it in the graveyard. It uses the addPiece method of the Graveyard class to add the captured piece, then removes the piece from
        the board. The method is called in the selectionHandler when the players selects a space containing an enemy piece.</li>

    <li><i>Check and Check-mate</i> -- The arbiter class keeps track of enemy threats in a list and when the king is
        attacked. And, if deemed appropriate, it puts the king into check and/or checkmate.</li>

    <li><i>Documentation</i> -- JavaDoc was used to add missing descriptions in all classes.</li>

    <li><i>GUI Implementation</i> -- A graphical representation was adapted using JavaFX and SceneBuilder rather
        than displaying the game on the command line.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Team members activities </h3>
  <p>Alexander Rose: To enhance communication, Alex created a Microsoft Teams group for the team. This was utilized in the early 
     stages of the project for team communication and document sharing. Alex worked on the movement logic for the Bishop and Knight 
     pieces. Following that, Alex created the Graveyard class and determined the need for the Player class with R.J., which R.J. 
     subsequently developed. Within the created Player class, Alex included a graveyard and created the capturing method. Additionally,
      Alex designed and created the castling logic to work in unison with the User Interface upgrades that were implemented. Alex created 
      the initial PowerPoint for the presentation, and helped with the development of the introductory slides. This was then shared with 
     the team using Sharepoint so that the other Team Members could add their own slides. Additionally, Alex included the Instructions
     in the User Manual.</p>

      R.J. Pereira: Contributed to game development (~2k lines): Arbiter object, Chess Engine object, King and Rook piece
      movement, Player parent class and children, Move object. Helped in testing the functionality of each delivered increment.<br>
      Contributed to software documentation (~1k lines): Ensuring that the entire codebase was documented in full, and
      writing portions of the final report, presentation, progress report and project proposal.

<h3>Improvements if given more time </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix Pawn special moves: en passant and promotion.</li>
        <li>Improve the chess engine's scoring of potential moves.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Evaluate whether a move under consideration improves the formation of the computer's pawns.​</li>
          <li>Recursive evaluation of possible counter-moves taken by the opponent.</li>
          <li>Optimize the relative weight of each score to make the engine's move more aggressive.</li>
          <li>Add logic for move optimization based on the stage of game play. For example end game decision making
              should be distinct from opening move game play.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
