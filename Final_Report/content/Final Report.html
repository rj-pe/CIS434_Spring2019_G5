<h2><center><u>Final Report</u></h2>
<h3>Process of creating Chess Game </h3>
  <p></p>

<h3>Software features</h3>
  <p></p>

<h3>Difficulties encountered </h3>
<p>As the team is developing the game in the agile method, we are organizing our development efforts around
    incremental delivery. Each increment is described by a GitHub
    <a href="https://github.com/rj-pe/CIS434_Spring2019_G5/projects/1">Issue </a>.
    This section details the outstanding issues which we are planning to address in future development increments:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Collision detection</i> -- makes sure that pieces can’t move over others.</li>

    <li><i>Castling</i> -- This is a special move that can be performed once in a game by each player.</li>

    <li><i>Capturing</i> -- This increment will allow pieces to capture other pieces.</li>

    <li><i>Check and Check-mate</i> -– This increment will develop the logic for attacking the King.</li>

    <li><i>Documentation</i> -- Go back and complete JavaDoc for existing classes and include documentation
        for any future code additions. </li>

    <li><i>GUI Implementation</i> -- Adapt command line solution to a graphical one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solutions implemented </h3>
<ul>
    <li><i>Collision detection</i> -- Added a method to check for enemies / friendly pieces. When one of these is
        encountered, the player is notified. </li>

    <li><i>Castling</i> -- Castling is a special King movement which consists of the king moving two spaces towards
        the rook and the rook moves to the position over which the king moved. This functionality... </li>

    <li><i>Capturing</i> -- If a piece captures another piece, the game should removes the captured piece and places
        it in the graveyard.</li>

    <li><i>Check and Check-mate</i> -- The game class keeps track of enemy threats in a list and when the king is
        attacked. And, if deemed appropriate, it puts the king into check and/or checkmate.</li>

    <li><i>Documentation</i> -- JavaDoc was used to add missing descriptions in all classes.</li>

    <li><i>GUI Implementation</i> -- A graphical representation was adapted using JavaFX and SceneBuilder rather
        than displaying the game on the command line.</li>
</ul>
