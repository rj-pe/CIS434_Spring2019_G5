<h3>Process of creating Chess Game </h3>
  <p></p>

<h3>Software features</h3>
    <li><i>Graveyard</i> -- The Graveyard stores the captured pieces of the enemy player and displays them. It is created as its own class, 
      which is created by the player class in order to keep them separate. The Graveyard keeps the captured pieces within the captured 
      ArrayList of the boardPiece class. It contains a method called addPiece which adds the piece to the ArrayList, and a method 
      called getGraveyard to return the captured ArrayList.</li>
    
  <li><i>Capturing</i> -- When a piece owned by the player moves to an appropriate enemy piece within range, the player captures that piece. The
    capturing process is part of the Player class.</li>
    
  <li><i>Castling</i> -- Castling is a special rule in Chess that permits the King and the Rook to switch positions. It is limited by 
      the following circumstances: neither the King nor Rook have moved, there are no pieces in the spaces between them, and the King is 
      not threatened in any of the spaces it must move through. </li>

<h3>Difficulties encountered </h3>
<p>As the team is developing the game in the agile method, we are organizing our development efforts around
    incremental delivery. Each increment is described by a GitHub
    <a href="https://github.com/rj-pe/CIS434_Spring2019_G5/projects/1">Issue </a>.
    This section details the outstanding issues which we are planning to address in future development increments:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Collision detection</i> -- makes sure that pieces can’t move over others.</li>

    <li><i>Castling</i> -- This is a special move that can be performed once in a game by each player.</li>

    <li><i>Capturing</i> -- This increment will allow pieces to capture other pieces.</li>

    <li><i>Check and Check-mate</i> -– This increment will develop the logic for attacking the King.</li>

    <li><i>Documentation</i> -- Go back and complete JavaDoc for existing classes and include documentation
        for any future code additions. </li>

    <li><i>GUI Implementation</i> -- Adapt command line solution to a graphical one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solutions implemented </h3>
<ul>
    <li><i>Collision detection</i> -- Added a method to check for enemies / friendly pieces. When one of these is
        encountered, the player is notified. </li>

    <li><i>Castling</i> -- Castling is a special King movement which consists of the king moving two spaces towards
        the rook and the rook moves to the position over which the king moved. In order to accomplish this, boardPiece contains the 
        boolean hasMoved which is set to true when a piece is processed through the transferPiece method. In the King class, this 
        boolean is checked to be false. If it is false, then it will look through the spaces between and check to see that they are 
        unoccupied, and not threatened. If it passes 0through this check, then it sets a boolean canCastleL or canCastleR to true. 
        These booleans indicate the direction of the rook piece. The King class then checks to see if the Rook's space is occupied, if 
        it is occupied by a Rook, and if it has moved. If all of these are valid, it sets the the space where the King transitions to as
        a possible move. Moving the rook is handled by the GameController class. During the process of movement, the pieceMovementHandler
        method checks to see if the piece is the king. If it is, it checks to see the number of spaces it moved by calculting the
        distance between the starting space and the selected space. If it is more than one or less than negative one, it moves the Rook
        appropriately.</p> </li>

    <li><i>Capturing</i> -- If a piece captures another piece, the game should removes the captured piece and places
        it in the graveyard. It uses the addPiece method of the Graveyard class to add the captured piece, then removes the piece from
        the board. The method is called in the selectionHandler when the players selects a space containing an enemy piece.</li>

    <li><i>Check and Check-mate</i> -- The game class keeps track of enemy threats in a list and when the king is
        attacked. And, if deemed appropriate, it puts the king into check and/or checkmate.</li>

    <li><i>Documentation</i> -- JavaDoc was used to add missing descriptions in all classes.</li>

    <li><i>GUI Implementation</i> -- A graphical representation was adapted using JavaFX and SceneBuilder rather
        than displaying the game on the command line.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Team members activities </h3>
  <li><i>Alexander Rose</i> -- To enhance communication, Alex created a Microsoft Teams group for the team. This was utilized in the early 
     stages of the project for team communication and document sharing. Alex worked on the movement logic for the Bishop and Knight 
     pieces. Following that, Alex created the Graveyard class and determined the need for the Player class with R.J., which R.J. 
     subsequently developed. Within the created Player class, Alex included a graveyard and created the capturing method. Additionally,
      Alex designed and created the castling logic to work in unison with the User Interface upgrades that were implemented. Alex created 
      the initial PowerPoint for the presentation, and helped with the development of the introductory slides. This was then shared with 
     the team using Sharepoint so that the other Team Members could add their own slides.</li>
