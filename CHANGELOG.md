# Changelog

All notable changes to this project should be recorded here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [0.0.2]
### Added
* 'src/boardlogic/Team.java' This is an enum which keeps track of whether a piece is WHITE or BLACK. This functionality
was formerly implemented in the `Player.Java' file. References to the former enum have been updated to reference the Team
 enum throughout the project. 
* `src/chess/Arbiter.Java` This object keeps track of the attack status of both players. If a players king is under attack
the arbiter class will inform the main method in the game.
* `getPotentialMoves()` method for each of the pieces, which calculates the possible moves that a piece may make given a
position on the board.
  *  `src/chess/pieces/Bishop.java`
  *  `src/chess/pieces/King.java`  A king can move a single space in any of eight possible directions.
  *  `src/chess/pieces/Knight.java`
  *  `src/chess/pieces/Pawn.java` A pawn can move forward exactly 1 space, or optionally, 2 spaces when on its starting square toward opponent's side. It may capture enemy piece that is one square diagonally ahead (left or right) of it. If it reaches back rank of opponent, it promotes to the player's choice of a piece except king.
  *  `src/chess/pieces/Queen.java` A queen can move any number of vacant squares in any direction in a straight line.
  *  `src/chess/pieces/Rook.java` A rook can move horizontally or vertically for any number of unoccupied squares.
*  `src/boardlogic/BoardSpace.checkForFriend()` A method which returns whether a given space is occupied by a teammate.
### Changed
* `src/boardlogic/Player.java` Formerly this was just an enum identifying whether a piece was WHITE or BLACK. 
The updated class is more robust and allows for methods and fields. The player class keeps track of teammates,
which spaces are threatened on the board, and will keep track of which pieces have been captured.
*  Calls to the array chess.board[ ][ ] in `main()` should refer to the y-coordinate then the x-coordinate. 
### Issues
* Implement logic for Castling functionality. Castling is a special King movement which consists of the king moving
two spaces towards the rook and the rook moves to the position over which the king moved.
* Implement testing to ensure that piece movement methods work over a wide range of scenarios.
* Implement king attack functionality. The game should keep track of when the king is attacked and put into checkmate.
* Implement piece capture logic. If a piece captures another piece, the game should remove the captured piece and place
it in the graveyard. 
  * Implement _en passant_ functionality for pawn capture.

## [0.0.1](https://github.com/rj-pe/CIS434_Spring2019_G5/commit/c674ea11988a803630b90b42e0479bc34945ff0f) - 2019-03-07
### Added
*  `src/boardlogic` Includes several classes which implement the functions that the game board must carry out.  
    *  `src/boardlogic/Board.java`  A class which represents a generic game board object. This object can be configured
for multiple games. The `setupChess()` method instantiates `BoardSpace` objects and places the chess pieces on those spaces.
    *  `src/boardlogic/BoardSpace.java` A class which represents a single space on the board. When a piece moves from one 
space to another it is the BoardSpace object which completes the transfer (see `transferPiece()` method).
    *  `src/boardlogic/BoardPiece.java` A Super Class which represents fundamental functionality of a game piece. The 
class provides methods and fields which are shared by all chess pieces, such as tracking the which player owns the piece.
    *  `src/boardlogic/Player.java` describes the two players in the chess game.
*  `src/chess/pieces` Includes each of the six piece Sub Classes that inherit from the `BoardPiece` Super Class and 
represent the chessman types. The functionality that is specific to a piece type shall be implemented in its Sub Class.
    *  `src/chess/pieces/ChessPieceFactory.java` A factory class which instantiates each of the required piece objects which
represent the chessmen.
*  `CMDChess.java` The main method of the program which interacts with the user, displays output of the game and instantiates
a game and it's supporting objects.
