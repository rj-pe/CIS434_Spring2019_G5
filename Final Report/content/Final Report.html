<h3>Process of creating Chess Game </h3>
  <p></p>

<h3>Software features</h3>
  <p>Graveyard: The Graveyard stores the captured pieces of the enemy player. It is created as its own class, which is created by the 
      player class in order to keep them separate. The Graveyard keeps the captured pieces within the captured ArrayList of the 
      boardPiece class. It contains a method called addPiece which adds the piece to the ArrayList, and a method called getGraveyard to 
      return the captured ArrayList.
  <p>Capturing: When a piece owned by the player moves to an appropriate enemy piece within range, the player captures that piece. The
    capturing process is part of the Player class. It uses the addPiece method of the Graveyard class to add the captured piece, then 
    removes the piece from the board. The method is called in the selectionHandler when the players selects a space containing an enemy 
    piece.</p>
  <p>Castling: Castling is a special rule in Chess that permits the King and the Rook to switch positions. It is limited by 
      the following circumstances: neither the King nor Rook have moved, there are no pieces in the spaces between them, and the King is 
    not threatened in any of the spaces it must move through. In order to accomplish this, boardPiece contains the boolean hasMoved which 
    is set to true when a piece is processed through the transferPiece method. In the King class, this boolean is checked to be false. If 
    it is false, then it will look through the spaces between and check to see that they are unoccupied, and not threatened. If it passes 
    through this check, then it sets a boolean canCastleL or canCastleR to true. These booleans indicate the direction of the rook piece. 
    The King class then checks to see if the Rook's space is occupied, if it is occupied by a Rook, and if it has moved. If all of these 
    are valid, it sets the the space where the King transitions to as a possible move. Moving the rook is handled by the GameController 
    class. During the process of movement, the pieceMovementHandler method checks to see if the piece is the king. If it is, it checks to 
    see the number of spaces it moved by calculting the distance between the starting space and the selected space. If it is more than one
    or less than negative one, it moves the Rook appropriately.</p>
